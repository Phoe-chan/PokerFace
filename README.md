A graphical Texas Hold 'em game to practice my Swing

Running

javac *.java
java GameWindow

at the moment the code is just in a formative state to prove to myself I can still handle Swing. The only real features are the skill based minigame for cheating, press B to activate the balance bar and then use A and D to try and keep the arrow in the green safe zone. Pressing N will deal a (fixed) new card to one player just to show the animation system running. Pressing Q will quit.
